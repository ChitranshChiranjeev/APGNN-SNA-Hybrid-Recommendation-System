# APGNN-SNA-Hybrid-Recommendation-System

## Abstract

This project presents a groundbreaking hybrid computational framework that systematically integrates **Personalized Graph Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism (A-PGNN)** and comprehensive **classical Social Network Analysis (SNA)** techniques for enhanced recommendation systems. Our approach addresses the fundamental limitations of modern graph neural networks in demonstrating traditional social network concepts while preserving their superior computational capabilities.

Our hybrid approach follows a systematic 4-phase implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** - Environment setup, dataset acquisition, and A-PGNN code analysis
2. **Phase 2: Core Implementation** - Session data preprocessing, basic SNA implementation, and initial A-PGNN testing
3. **Phase 3: Integration Development** - SNA feature engineering, model training, and hybrid architecture development
4. **Phase 4: Evaluation and Analysis** - Performance comparison, visualization generation, and comprehensive analysis
