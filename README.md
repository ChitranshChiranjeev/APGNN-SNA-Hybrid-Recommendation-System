# APGNN-SNA-Hybrid-Recommendation-System

## Abstract

This project presents a groundbreaking hybrid computational framework that systematically integrates **Personalized Graph Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism (A-PGNN)** and comprehensive **classical Social Network Analysis (SNA)** techniques for enhanced recommendation systems. Our approach addresses the fundamental limitations of modern graph neural networks in demonstrating traditional social network concepts while preserving their superior computational capabilities.

Our hybrid approach follows a systematic 4-phase implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** - Environment setup, dataset acquisition, and A-PGNN code analysis
2. **Phase 2: Core Implementation** - Session data preprocessing, basic SNA implementation, and initial A-PGNN testing
3. **Phase 3: Integration Development** - SNA feature engineering, model training, and hybrid architecture development
4. **Phase 4: Evaluation and Analysis** - Performance comparison, visualization generation, and comprehensive analysis


## üìä Dataset

**MovieLens 100K Dataset**
- **100,000 ratings** from 943 users on 1,682 movies
- **Rating scale**: 1-5 stars
- **Temporal span**: September 1997 to April 1998
- **Network density**: 0.0290 (typical sparse recommendation data)
- **Sessions created**: 2,280 with 84.5% retention rate

## üî¨ Technical Approach

### Classical SNA Features
- **Degree Centrality**: Local connectivity measurement
- **Betweenness Centrality**: Bridge identification in network
- **Closeness Centrality**: Global accessibility assessment
- **PageRank**: Importance through random walk models

### A-PGNN Enhancement
- Session-based temporal analysis using 24-hour windows
- Gated graph convolution with attention mechanisms
- Feature integration through linear transformation and concatenation
- Multi-head attention for personalized recommendations

### Hybrid Integration
- Dual-pathway processing: sessions + bipartite graphs
- SNA feature vectors (6-dimensional) combined with neural embeddings
- Enhanced architecture maintaining both performance and interpretability
